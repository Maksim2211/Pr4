                <p>
                    Chinchillas are small social rodents known for their soft,
                    plush fur as well as their quiet and shy demeanor. 
                    They are agile and athletic with the ability to climb well and jump up to six feet.
                    Chinchillas require constant chewing to keep their continually growing teeth trimmed. 
                    They often sit upright to sunbathe, groom, and to eat with their front paws.
